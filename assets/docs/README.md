Place your exported screenshots here and reference them from the main README.md using relative paths, for example:

![Home screen](assets/docs/screen1.png)
![Home screen - success](assets/docs/screen3.png)

Tips:
- Prefer PNG or JPG, 1080x2340 or similar for phone screenshots.
- Keep filenames short and lowercased.
